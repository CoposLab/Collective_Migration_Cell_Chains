MATLAB codes for making kymographs of traction stresses and doublet length over time using simulation data from running C/C++ codes

List of MATLAB codes:
1. To generate the kymograph of traction stresses and doublet length figure, use:

    MakeKymograph.m

    Note: please remember to specify the directory of simulation data (change "FileDir") and adjust the name of your data files at the beginning of the code

2. To produce a kymograph using red-black-blue color scheme (default), use:

    generate_bipolar_colormap.m

3. Alternative choice of a blue-white-red color scheme, switch to:

    polarmap.m
