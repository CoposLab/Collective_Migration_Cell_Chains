# Two-dimensional mechanic-based models of collective migration of tandem cell pairs

A Morse potential is used to describe cell-cell adhesion at the intercellular junction.

List of directory:
1. Configurations:

      Initial configurations of cell boundary and cell-matrix adhesions of each cell in the doublet
   
2. Model_simulation:

      C/C++ codes for simulating models with input files from "Configuration"

3. Result_processing:

      MATLAB codes for producing kymographs of traction stresses and doublet length over time using simulation data from running C/C++ codes

4. Example

     Examples of kymographs, doublet length over time, and movies
